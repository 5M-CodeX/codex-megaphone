# Codex Megaphone

Codex Megaphone is a script for FiveM that allows you to interact with pedestrians in front of an emergency vehicle. It provides the ability to stop pedestrians and make them kneel down using keybinds or commands.

## Features

2. Place the `codex-megaphone` folder inside your FiveM server's resource directory.

3. Add `ensure codex-megaphone` to your server.cfg file.

## Usage

In-game, you can use the following keybinds and commands:

- Press **L** key to toggle the stop action for pedestrians in front of the vehicle.
- Use the command `/stop` to manually trigger the stop action.
